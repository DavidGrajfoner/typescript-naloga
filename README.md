Code samples for FE dev assessment

To be considered:

base components - reuseable component and css. Base component is used in project components as building block
    -  BaseCheckbox.tsx
    -  BaseCheckbox.scss

project components - project specific components. 
    -  JourneyDetailsSteps: Parent component (connection with the server, loads child components)
    -  StepForm: Child component
    -  Menu: Child component             
    -  BaseMenuBar: Base component, child child from Menu component

Assignment: Inspect base and project components and try to figure it out what is wrong with the code, what could be done better, in which way, etc.
Note: Those file can not be built, and probably contain some errors, its purpose is only for review / comprehension / critique purposes.

Expected feedback:
Review the code
Code quality
Are there any issues?
errors
bad practices
suspicious practices
Any other observations or suggestions?
